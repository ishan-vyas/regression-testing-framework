## Regression Testing of Machine Learning Classifiers
Project submission by: Ishan Vyas
Supervised by 
Dr. Frank Maurer

## Synopsis
There is a lack of regression testing frameworks for machine learning classifiers. Regression testing for software ensures that modifications to the software do not introduce new bugs and flaws to the code. Similarly, regression testing for machine learning classifiers is essential as it would ensure that new changes to the algorithm do not introduce behavioral changes to the system. By building on evidence from existing testing methods for machine learning systems, the research develops a regression testing framework. By using regression testing for machine learning systems, we can build better-tested systems and add a level of confidence to our development.

## Research Aim
To develop a guide to regression testing framework 

## Instructions
Open the .ipynb files in the jupyer notebook and run all cells.
